## Code of Conduct

This project is governed by its [Code of Conduct](/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Report unacceptable
behavior to [contact@lewx.dev](mailto:contact@lewx.dev).

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, read any available documentation first.

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [issues](/issues)
that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need
clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable
to search the internet for answers first.

If you still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, do the
following:

- Open an [issue](/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide any project, dependency, and platform versions (depending on what
  seems relevant).

Your issue will be addressed as soon as possible, but please be patient. Most
projects are maintained by myself (or a handful of people) in their free time.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report <!-- omit in toc -->

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you down for more
information. Therefore, investigate carefully, collect information and describe
the issue in detail in your report. Also complete the following steps in advance
to help fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using
  incompatible environment versions (If you are looking for support, you might
  want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the
  same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing
  for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if
  users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace
  - OS, platform and version
  - Version of the project, dependencies, etc.
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with
    older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report? <!-- omit in toc -->

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs
> including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public.
> Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to
> [security@lewx.dev](mailto:security@lewx.dev).

- Open an [issue](/issues/new?title=fix%3A%20%5BCHANGEME%5D&labels=bug)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Provide as much context as possible and describe the
  _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on
  their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should
  isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- A maintainer will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If
  there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, it
  will be marked as `needs-repro` and you will be asked for those steps. Bugs
  with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If your issue is reproducible, it will be marked `needs-fix`, and the issue
  will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion,
**including new features and improvements to existing functionality**. Following
these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your
suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement <!-- omit in toc -->

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Perform a [search](/issues?q=label%3Aenhancement) to see if the enhancement
  has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue
  instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of this project. It's
  up to you to make a strong case of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind
  that features should be useful to the _majority_ of end users and not just a
  small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider building
  your own solution :wink:.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion? <!-- omit in toc -->

- Open an [issue](/issues/new?title=feat%3A%20%5BCHANGEME%5D&labels=enhancement).
- Use a **clear and descriptive title** that's easily identifiable.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many
  details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and
  **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point
  you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and/or animated GIFs** which help
  demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related
  to. (You can use a tool like [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) on
  macOS and Windows and [Silentcast](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast)
  on Linux)
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users. You may also
  want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could
  serve as inspiration.
